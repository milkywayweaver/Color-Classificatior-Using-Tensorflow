# Color Classificator Using Tensorflow

A first-time Tensorflow project. The aim is to train a supervised model that learns color from its RGB values (converted from hexcodes).

## Data Used for Training
Data used for training are color hexcodes and its corresponding color label (such as Red, Green, and Blue)
